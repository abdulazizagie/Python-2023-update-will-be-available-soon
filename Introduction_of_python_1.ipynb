    "progtamming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb nachine and it only does what we tell it do . Hence we learn programing and tell computer to do what we are very slow at- computation. if I ask you to calculate 5+6,you will immediatly say 11.\n",

    "You will strat searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from strating to the end . We will strat from 0and by the time we end this coures.I promise youn will be a job ready python developer\n",

    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "- Python is a dynamically typed , general purpose programing language that supports an object-oriendet-programing approch as well as a funcation programing approch.\n",
    "- python is an  interpreted and a highe level programing language.\n",
    "- It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "- pyhthon as a simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "- It is Interpreted and platform-independent which  make dobugging very easy.\n",
    "- python is an open-source programming language.\n",
    "- python provides very big library support .some of the popular libraries include Numpy , Tensofloe,selenim,OpenCv,etc.\n",
    "- It is possible to integrate other programing language within python\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python used for\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is used in Data Visualization  to create plots and graphical repesentations.\n",
    "- Python help in Data Analytics to analyze and undertand raw data for insight and trends.\n",
    "- It is used in Ai and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard  coding.\n",
    "- It is used to create web application.\n",
    "- It can be used to handle database.\n",
    "- It is used in business and acconting to perform complex mathematical operation along with quantitive and qualtitative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Replit?\n",
    "- Replit is very easy to share totorials and code \n",
    "- You can easly fork this repl and continue learning in your own style.Video,Code as well as text tutorial on the same page which makes thing easy!\n",
    "- For fellow techers out there ,you create a tutorical folder to create tutorials using replit\n",
