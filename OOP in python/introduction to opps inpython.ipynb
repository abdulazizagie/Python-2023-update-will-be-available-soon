    "### Introducation to object-oriented programming\n",
    "introducation to object-oriented programming in python.In programming language,mainly there are two approaches that are  used to write program or code.\n",
    "1. Procedural Programming\n",
    "2. Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure we are follow till now is the \"Procedural Programming\" approach,So , in this ssession,we will learn avout objrct oriented programming(OOP).The basic  idea og object-oriented programming(OOP) in python is use to  class and object to represent real-world concept and entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or temple for creating objects,It defines the proerties and mthod that an object of that class will have.Properites are the data or stat of an object,and mehtods are the actions or behaviors that an object perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class ,and it contains its own data and methods,For example you could create a class called\"Person\" that has properties such as name  age,and method such as speak() and walk().Each instance of the person class would be a unique object with its own name and age ,But they would all have the same methods to speak and walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key feature of OOP in python is encapsulation, which mean that the internal stat of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods , This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpacted ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key featur of OOP in python is inheritance, which allows new class to be created that inherit the properties and method of an existing class, This allows dor code reuse and makes it easy to create new class that have similar funcation to existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ploymorphism is also supported in python, which means that object of different classes can be trared as id thay were objects of a common class , This allows for greater flexibilty in code and makes it easier to write code that  can work with multiple types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary , OOP in python allows developers to model real-world conocepts and entites using class and object , encapsulate data, reuse codethrough inheritance , and write more flexible code through polymorphism."
