    "### Regular Expressions in python\n",
    "Regular expression, or \"regex\" for short , ae a powerful tool for wprking with strings and text data in python.They allow you to match and manipulate string based on patterns, makinf it easy to perform comples string operations with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matacharacters in regular expressions\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[] Represent a character class Matches the beginning \n",
    "$ mathch any the end \n",
    ". Matches any character except newline\n",
    "? Matches zero or one accurrence. \n",
    "| Means OR (Matches with any of the charachers\n",
    "                                    separated by it.)\n",
    "* Any number of occurrences\n",
    "(including 0 occurrences)\n",
    "+ une or more occurrences\n",
    "{} Indicate number of occurrences of a preceding RE to match.\n",
    "() Enclose a group of REs\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Importing re Package\n",
    "In python , regular expressions are supported by the `re` module.The basic syntax for working with regular expressions in python is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Searching for a pattern in re using re.search() Method\n",
    "re.search() method either return None (if the pattern doesn't match),or a re.MatchObject that contains information aboutt the matching part of the string.This method stops after the first match,so thi best suited for testing a regular expression more than extracting data.We can use re.search method like this to search for a pattern in regular expression:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Define a regular expression pattern\n",
    "pattern = r\"expression\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Match the pattern against a string\n",
    "text = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "match = re.search(pattern,text)\n",
    "\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(\"Match found!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Match not found\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Searching for a pattern in re using re.findall() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the re.findall findall funcation to find all occurrences of the pattern is a string:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "pattern = r\"expression\"\n",
    "text = \"The cat is in the hat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(matches)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Replacing a pattern\n",
    "The following example shows how to replace a pattern in a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "pattern = r\"[a-z]+at\"\n",
    "text = \"The cat is in the hat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "matches = re.findall(pattern,text)\n",
    "\n",
    "parint(matches)\n",
    "\n",
    "new_text = re.sub(pattern,\"dog\",text)\n",
