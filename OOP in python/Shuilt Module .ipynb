    "### Shuilt Module in python\n",
    "Shutil is a python module that provides a higher level inherface for working with file and directories.The name \"shutil\" is short for shell utility.It provides a convenient and efficient way to automate tasks that are commonly performed on files and directories.In this repl,well take a closer look at the shutil module and its various funcations and how they can be used in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing shuilt\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for importing the shutil module is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Funcations\n",
    "The following are some of the most commonly used funcation in the shuilt module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copy(src,dst)`:This funcation copies the file located at src to a new location specified by dst.If the destination location already exists, the orignal file will be overwritten.\n",
    "- `shutil.copy2(src,dst)`:This funcation is similar to shutil.copy but it also preserves more metadata about the orignal file , such as the timestamp.\n",
    "- `shutil.copytree(sec,dst)`:This funcation recusively copies the directorylocation at src to a new location specified by dst.if the destination location already exist, the original directory will be merged with it.\n",
    "- `shutil.move(src,dst)`:This funcation moves the file located at src to a new location specified by dst.This funcation is equivalent to renaminga file in most cases.\n",
    "- `shutil.rmtree(path)`: This funcation recursively deletes the directory located at path, long with all of its contents.This funcation is similar to using the rm -rf command in a shell"
