    "## Access Specifiers/Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Access specifiers or access modifiers in python programming are used to limit the access of class variable and class methods outside of class while implementing the concepts of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of a acces specifiers\n",
    "1. Public access modifier\n",
    "2. private access modifier\n",
    "3. Protected access modifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Access Specifier in python\n",
    "All the variable and method (member funcation) in python are by defult public ,Any instance variable in a class followed bt the'self' keyword ie. self.var_name are public accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self,age,name):\n",
    "        self.age = age   # public variable\n",
    "        self.name = name  # public variable\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = student(21,\"Harray\")\n",
    "print(obj.age)\n",
    "print(obj.name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "```python\n",
    "21\n",
    "Harray\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private Access Modifier\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition , privite member of a class (variable or methods) are those some other programming language.However, a convention has been established to indicate that a variable or method should be considered private by profixing its name with an underscore(_).This is know as a \"weak internal use indicator\" and it is a convention only, not a strict rule. Code outside the class can still access these\"private\" variable and methods,but it is generally understood that they should not be accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self,age,name):\n",
    "        self.__age = age # An indication of private variable\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __funcation(self): # An indication of privite funcation\n",
    "\n",
    "        self.y = 34\n",
    "        print(self.y)\n",
    "class Subject(Student):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = student(21,\"aziz\")\n",
    "obj1 = Subject\n",
    "\n",
    "# classing by object of class Student\n",
    "print(obj.__age)\n",
    "print(obj.__funcation())\n",
    "\n",
    "#classing by object of class subject\n",
    "print(obj1.__age)\n",
    "print(obj1.__funcation())\n",
    "```\n",
    "Privite memner of a class cannot be accessed or inherited outside of class .If we try to access or to inherit the propertie of private members to child class (derived class).Then ot will show the arror.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name mangling\n",
    "Name maangling in python is a technique used to protect class-private and superclass-private attributes from being accidentally overwritten by subclass.Name of class-private and superclass-private attributes are transformed by the addition of a single leading underscore and a double leading underscore respectively.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCalss:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__private_attribute = \"I am a private attribute\"\n",
    "        self.__mangled_attribute = \"I am a mangled  attribut\"\n",
    "\n",
    "my_object = Myclass()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_object._private_attribute) # Output: I am a privite attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_object.__mangled_attribute) # Throws an AttributeError\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_object._Myclass__mangled_attribute) # Output: I am a mangled attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the attribute_private is marked as private by convention,but can still be accessed from outside the class. The attribute __mangle_attrivude is private and its name is \"mangled\" to outside the class,but you can access it by calling_Myclass__mangled_attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protected Access Modifier\n",
    "In object-oriented programming(OOP),the term \"protected\" is used to describe a member(i.e,a method or attribute) of a class that is intended to be accessed only by the class itself and its subclasses.In oython, the convention for indicating that a member is protected os to prefix its name with a single underscore(_).For example,if a class has method called_my_method,it is indicating that the method shoulod only be accessed by the class itself and its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the single underscore is just a naming convention , and does not actuall provide any protection or restrict access to the member .The syntax we follow to amke any variable project is to write variable name followed by a single underscore(_) ie._variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._name = \"Herry\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _funcation(self):     # protected method\n",
    "        return \"CodewihAziz\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Subject(student):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Student()\n",
    "odj1 = Student()\n",
    "\n",
    "# calling by object student class\n",
    "print(obj._name())\n",
    "print(obj._funcation())\n",
    "# calling by object of subject class\n",
    "print(obj1.name)\n",
