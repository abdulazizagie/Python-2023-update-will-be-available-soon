    "### Lambda Funcation in python\n",
    "\n",
    "in python a lambda funcation is a small anonymous funcation without a name .It is defined using the lambda keyword and has the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda arguments:expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda funcation are other used in situations where a small funcation is required for a short period of time ,They are commonly used as arguments to higher-order funcation,such as map filter , and reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use a lambda funcation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# funcation to double the imput\n",
    "\n",
    "def double(x):\n",
    "    return x*2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lambda funcation to double the input\n",
    "Lambda x: x*2\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above Lambda duncation has the same funcationality as the double funcation defined earler.However, the Lambda funcation is anonymous,as it does not have a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda funcation can have multiple argument, hust like regular funcations,Here is an example of a lambda funcation with multiple arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Funcation to calculate the product of two numbers\n",
    "def multiply(x,y):\n",
    "    return x*y\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lambda funcation to calculate the product of two numbers\n",
    "lambda x,y:x*y\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lambda funcation can also include multiple statments,but they are limited to a single expression.For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Lambda funcation to calculate the product of two numbers,\n",
    "# with additional print statment\n",
    "Lambda x,y:print(f'{x} * {y} = {x * y}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example , the lambda funcation includes a print statment ,but it is still limited to a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda funcation are often used in conjunction with higher-order funcation,such as map,filter and reduce which we will look into later."
